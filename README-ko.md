# Java Object-Oriented Programming Projects

This repository contains a series of Java programming assignments that demonstrate key concepts in object-oriented programming. Each project covers a specific topic and illustrates practical applications of these concepts.

## Projects Overview

1. **Geometric Shapes**
    - **Abstract Class:** Created an abstract class `GeometricShape` with abstract methods `area()` and `perimeter()`.
    - **Subclasses:** Implemented subclasses `Triangle` and `Square` that extend `GeometricShape` and calculate the area and perimeter.

2. **Vehicle Class Hierarchy**
    - **Base Class:** Developed a base class `Vehicle` with properties such as make, model, year, and fuel type.
    - **Subclasses:** Created `Truck`, `Car`, and `Motorcycle` subclasses with methods for calculating fuel efficiency, distance traveled, and maximum speed.

3. **Book Class**
    - **Private Variables:** Defined a class `Book` with private instance variables `title`, `author`, and `price`.
    - **Getter and Setter Methods:** Provided public getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying these variables.
    - **Discount Method:** Added a method `applyDiscount()` to reduce the price by a given percentage.

4. **Animal Class Hierarchy**
    - **Base Class:** Created a base class `Animal` with methods `eat()` and `sound()`.
    - **Subclasses:** Developed `Lion`, `Tiger`, and `Panther` subclasses that override the `eat()` and `sound()` methods with specific behaviors for each animal.

5. **Payment System Interface**
    - **Interface Definition:** Defined an interface `Payment` with methods `pay(double amount)` and `getPaymentDetails()`.
    - **Implementations:** Implemented the interface in `CreditCardPayment` and `PayPalPayment` classes, using polymorphism to process payments.
